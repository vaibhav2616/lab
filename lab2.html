        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
        <p>Allah Rakha Rahman (pronunciationⓘ; born A. S. Dileep Kumar; 6 January 1967) is an Indian music composer, record producer, singer, songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, and philanthropist[1] known for his works in Indian cinema; predominantly in Tamil and Hindi films, with occasional forays in international cinema. He is a recipient of six National Film Awards, two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, fifteen Filmfare Awards, and eighteen Filmfare Awards South.[2] In 2010, the Government of India conferred him with the Padma Bhushan, the nation's third-highest civilian award.[3]

            With his in-house studio Panchathan Record Inn, Rahman's film-scoring career began during the early 1990s with the Tamil film Roja.[4] Following that, he went on to score several songs for Tamil language films, including Mani Ratnam's politically charged Bombay, the urban Kadhalan, Thiruda Thiruda, and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman. Rahman's score for his first Hollywood film, the comedy Couples Retreat (2009), won the BMI Award for Best Score. His music for Slumdog Millionaire (2008) earned him Best Original Score and Best Original Song (for Jai Ho) at the 81st Academy Awards. He was also awarded Best Compilation Soundtrack Album and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 2010 Grammy Awards. He is nicknamed "Isai Puyal" (musical storm) and "Mozart of Madras".[5]
            
            Rahman has also become a humanitarian and philanthropist, donating and raising money for a number of causes and charities. In 2006, he was honoured by Stanford University for his contributions to global music.[6] In 2008, he received Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rotary Club of Madras.[7] In 2009, he was included on the Time list of the world's 100 most influential people.[8] In 2013, he introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films.[9] In 2014, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music. He has also received honorary doctorate from Aligarh Muslim University.[10] In 2017, he made his debut as a director and writer for the film Le Musk.[11]
            
            Early life
            Allah Rakha Rahman[12] was born as Dileep Kumar Rajagopala in Madras, Tamil Nadu, on 6 January 1967.[13] His father, R. K. Shekhar from a Mudaliar[14][15] family, was a film score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films. Rahman began studying piano at age four.[13] He assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard.
            
            After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income.[16] Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi),[17] Rahman, who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family, which led to him to routinely miss classes and fail exams. In an interview in 2012, Rahman said that his mother was summoned and was told to take him to the streets of Kodambakkam to beg and not to send him to the school any more.[18][19]
            
            Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year,[20] and later joined the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School, where he was admitted for his musical talent and formed a band with his high school classmates.[21][22] However, after discussing it with his mother, he later dropped out of school to pursue a career as a full-time musician.[23][24] Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo and Raja)[25] and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue.[26] He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the "ideal combination of music and technology".[27]
            
            Rahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj,[28][29] and at age 11 began playing in the orchestra of a Malayalam composer (and close friend of his father) M. K. Arjunan.[30] He soon began working with other composers, such as M. S. Viswanathan, Vijaya Bhaskar,[2] Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu, Vijay Anand, Hamsalekha and Raj–Koti,[29] accompanied Zakir Hussain, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan and L. Shankar on world tours and obtained a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music.[17] During his early career, Rahman had assisted many music directors to play keyboard and synthesizer. One of the notable works includes a Malayalam film, Ramji Rao Speaking released in 1989 where Rahman and Sivamani programmed a song called "Kalikalam" for the music director S. Balakrishnan</p>
